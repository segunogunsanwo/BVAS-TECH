# BVAS-TECH
A DevOps project

our aim is to connect IT engineers who have taken some sort of training or have attended boot camps with the much needed work experience.
We take our students through some rigorous challenges where they ramp up expertise as they go through different stages. after which winners are rewarded by inviting them to work on real jobs where they will be mentored by senior developers etc
